	 * A company needs to track payments for two types of Employees:
	 * Salaried and Hourly. Salaried employees have a specific annual salary
	 * that they are paid, regardless of the number of hours they work each 
	 * week. Hourly employees are paid by an hourly rate, and their pay depends
	 * on the hours worked.
	 * 
	 * Here's a solution which given a list of employees creates a report
	 * showing the pay for all current employees. The order of the employees
	 * in the report is not important.
	 * 
	 * Use interfaces to remove the code duplication and create one method that
	 * can be used for both kinds of employees.
	 * 
	 * It currently passes unit tests and should still pass them after you make
	 * your changes.
